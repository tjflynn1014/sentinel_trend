Sentinel Trend

Sentinel Trend is a minimalist research scaffold for a monthly trend-following
rotation between SPY and BIL using a 200-day simple moving average signal.
It focuses on clean data plumbing and reproducible experiments first, with
paper trading and broker integrations planned later.

Run tests:
